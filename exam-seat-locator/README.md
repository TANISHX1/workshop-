# Exam Seat Locator

Lightweight Flask app for students to find their assigned exam seat.
Enter roll number + exam date + time slot -> see classroom grid with your seat highlighted.

## Setup & Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Drop one or more PLAN-*.json files into data/
python app.py
# -> http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

> **Retention period** — edit `PLAN_RETENTION_DAYS` and `CLEANUP_INTERVAL_DAYS` in `config.py`
> to change how long plan files are kept and how often the daemon scans.

---

## How It Works

1. On startup `AppCache.load()` scans `data/PLAN-*.json`, builds `summary_index.json`
2. Top-3 most-hit plan files are pre-warmed into the LRU
3. Cleanup daemon starts immediately — deletes any plan file older than `PLAN_RETENTION_DAYS` days, then sleeps for `CLEANUP_INTERVAL_DAYS` days and repeats
4. Student searches: roll number -> `_index` (O(1)) -> filename -> LRU hit or disk read -> seat
5. Result page renders classroom grid; clicking your seat opens a detail card

---

## Adding New Plan Files

- Drop a new `PLAN-*.json` into `data/` and hit `POST /reload`, **or**
- Use the upload button on the home page — index rebuilds automatically, no restart needed

---

## Routes

| Route | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | GET | Search form with dynamic date/time dropdowns |
| `/search` | POST | Look up seat by roll number + date + time |
| `/upload` | POST | Upload a new `PLAN-*.json` file |
| `/reload` | POST | Rebuild index + clear LRU; returns stats JSON |

---

## Architecture

- **`AppCache`** — singleton loaded once at startup; no per-request I/O on warm paths
- **`LRUCache`** — thread-safe, `maxsize=5`; evicts least-recently-used plan on overflow
- **`summary_index.json`** — maps every roll number -> list of filenames; fits in L2 cache (~200KB)
- **`student_index`** — `(roll, date, start, end)` -> `{room, session, row, col}` — O(1) lookup
- **`matrix.py`** — stores `position` (e.g. `B5`) in every cell for grid-ref display
- **`cleanup.py`** — daemon thread (`daemon=True`); first run immediately at startup, then every `CLEANUP_INTERVAL_DAYS` days; calls `cache.reload()` after any deletion

### Adjusting retention

All cleanup timing is controlled by two constants in `config.py` — change them once and every part of the system picks up the new value automatically:

```python
PLAN_RETENTION_DAYS   = 15   # delete files older than this
CLEANUP_INTERVAL_DAYS = 15   # how often the daemon wakes up
```

## Performance

| Scenario | Time |
|---|---|
| Warm search (LRU hit) | ~4-9ms |
| Cold search (LRU miss) | ~80-190ms (one-time NVMe read) |
| Info card open | <1ms JS + 300ms animation |
| RAM footprint (788 students, 3 files) | ~65MB |
